This project was created to simulate a data transmission from a ofdm - transmitter over a awgn channel to a ofdm receiver.

For some example plots --> Documentation 
(not much yet) 

How to run the code?? 
    - install numpy and matplotlib 
    - from OFDM_System, run: python OFDM_System.py 

Basic features are:
- 16QAM IQ - Mapper,
- OFDM Modem 
- IQ Modulator that creates real bandpass signals (analytic low pass signal <-> bandpasssignal) 
- Spectrum - Analyser and Scope,
- Dynmaic spectrum and signal visualization 
- Simulation of CFO - distortions 
- guard interval options for intermodulation protection
- BER / BEP measuring.





Future Features:

    Signal Processing:
        PHY:
            - QPSK preamble
            - Scrambler
            - FEC
                - Interleaver
                - RS - Codec ?? 
            - adaptive modulation scheme based on the transmission channel properties 
    
    Software features: 
        - use Python Dispatcher for an event - based solution (simulating interrupts)
        - Server/Client model
            - Server (Python): signal processing
            - Client:
                - Website with Flask or Dash
